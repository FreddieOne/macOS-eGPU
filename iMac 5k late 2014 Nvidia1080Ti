Hallo,
for some time I try to get my Nvidia card running, often I failed.
Now I had a little success.
The egpu is now reconginzed by the system

But the starting procedure ends up with the blurred starting screen

Help now would be much appreciated.
I add the installation log

The script will soon close (kill) all programs.
Please abort the script now should you wish to do it manually and save your work.
Please do not, under any circumstances abort the script later during the execution.
This might break your system.

The script might automatically reboot the system after successful execution.
To safely abort the script now, press ^C.
